<h1>DIS08 - Data Modeling 2021</h1>
<h2>First lesson</h2>
<h3>The beginning - general information</h3>
<b>Name:</b> Lennart Batz<br>
<b>E-Mail:</b> lennart.batz@smail.th-koeln.de<br>
<h3>The beginning - information about me, this subject and my expectations</h3>
<b>Do you have any prior experience in the field introduced in the introductory session? If so, give a short overview on them.</b><br>
<p>Since I study Data and Information Science I often came in contact with data including everything which belongs to it. Before my study I knew that it exists and it was a topic what does interest me. I also knew the importance today and in the near future. In the first and second semester I discussed topics, which belong to data. For example I learned how to correctly present given data in diagrams. In an other subject I learned the programming language Python. With this new ability I am able to find information, which are important for me or other organisations, from texts or other data sources.</p>
<b>What expectations or wishes do you have on the data modeling course?</b><br>
<p>I wish to improve my skills to deal with Python and learn new abilities to work with data. Especially I expect that we learn how to extract, transform and load data in various scopes of application.</p>
